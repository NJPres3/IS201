        <h3>The Greatest Season Ever Played</h3>
        <p>
            His most dominant season was in 2000-2001, when he not only won 9 tournaments, but he also complete was become known as the tiger slam. A grand slam in golf is winning all four majors (The Masters, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and The PGA Championship) in a single year. A career grand slam is considered winning one of each of these tournaments sometime throughout your career. 
            While a handful of legends have completed the career grand slam, none have ever completed the grand slam. Tiger Woods was the closest to do so in 2000-2001 when he won the 2000 U.S. Open, 2000 Open Championship, 2000 PGA Championship, and the 2001 Masters, holding all four majors at the same time: an accomplishment that has become known as the tiger slam. 
            His dominance was not just in the majors, Tiger seemed to win almost every regular PGA tour event that he showed up to. His mental fortitude was much stronger that his opponents and his intense dedication to practice earned him a textbook perfect swing that outmatch all other players in the field. Here is a video of that famous swing:
